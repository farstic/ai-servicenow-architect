# HLD/LLD Writer — Examples

Three gold-standard examples of HLD/LLD Writer output. Each example shows the input, the produced document, and an explanation of why each choice was made — including the baseline-first audit pattern and the rule that the baseline is weighed before any `OPEN QUESTION — CUSTOM OBJECT PROPOSAL` is raised.

## 1. Executive Summary

Acme Customer Service Management currently handles ~3,500 cases per month across 120 agents in Australia and New Zealand. The escalation process today is informal: agents email duty managers directly, with no structured capture of escalation reasons and no auditable trail tying the escalation to the case record. This causes three downstream problems: (a) duty managers receive escalations with insufficient context, (b) escalation patterns cannot be analysed for service-improvement initiatives, and (c) post-incident reviews lack traceability.

The Acme CSM Case Escalation programme delivers a structured escalation capability over six months in four releases:

1. **R1 — Case escalation** (this HLD's primary scope; the Escalation Button feature, delivered on the baseline): the agent escalates from the case's Escalate Case related link, the Escalation form captures reason, justification, severity and template, the duty manager on the escalation's watch list is emailed, and the escalation's updates are replicated to the case's work notes *(citations: `markdown/customer-service-management/escalate-csm-case.md`, `markdown/customer-service-management/case-escalation-process.md`, `markdown/customer-service-management/case-escalation-form.md`)*.
2. **R2 — Escalation Reporting** (Q3): Performance Analytics dashboards on escalation rate, reason mix, and duty manager response time.
3. **R3 — On-Call Rota Integration** (Q4): replace the static `sys_user_group.manager` resolution with an On-Call Management rota for duty managers.
4. **R4 — Manager-Side De-Escalation** (Q4): structured workflow for duty managers to de-escalate a case with documented disposition; the baseline de-escalation requester role covers it (OD-01).

**Architectural commitment:** the programme is delivered entirely on baseline `sn_customerservice` constructs. No custom tables, no new scoped apps, no custom state values. The audit trail uses the case's `work_notes` journal — eliminating ~6 months of platform-upgrade compatibility risk and reducing ongoing support cost. This is captured in §10 Baseline-first audit.

**Business benefits:** structured escalation reduces mean time to senior-attention by 35–50% (industry baseline for similar programmes), audit trail satisfies internal compliance requirements without additional reporting overhead, and the analytics-ready reporting in R2 enables data-driven service-improvement decisions in subsequent quarters.

**Cost / timeline:** R1 estimated at 5–8 story points (~2-week sprint); R2–R4 estimated separately as Q3/Q4 deliveries.

## 2. Solution Overview

### 2.1 Scope

| In scope (R1) | Out of scope (R1, deferred to R2–R4) |
|---|---|
| The baseline Escalate Case related link on the case form | Escalation analytics dashboards (R2) |
| Reason, Escalation Justification, severity and template on the baseline Escalation form | On-Call rota integration (R3) |
| An Escalation record on the case — the baseline escalation feature, per OD-01 | De-escalation workflow (R4) |
| Audit trail: the Escalation record, and its updates replicated to the case's work notes | Custom escalation history table (rejected per §1.1) |
| Email to the duty manager on the escalation's watch list | Mobile-app integration |
| Escalation severities and templates configured for Acme | Changes to the baseline Escalation form |

### 2.2 Assumptions and constraints

- "Regional duty manager" is the `manager` of the case's `assignment_group` (`sys_user_group.manager`). In R1 the agent adds them to the escalation's watch list; an escalation template can also add the case assignment group's manager to the approvers *(citation: `markdown/customer-service-management/create-escalation-template.md`)*. R3 replaces the manual step with On-Call Management.
- Escalation updates are replicated to the case's own work notes. No custom audit table is in scope for any release of this programme.
- Escalation uses the baseline case and account escalation feature: an Escalation record [`sn_customerservice_escalation`] against the case, not a new state value (see OD-01).
- All work lives in the baseline `sn_customerservice` scope. No new scoped app.
- Release family is Australia.

### 2.3 Dependencies

- Acme CSM Practice has confirmed the duty-manager resolution rule for R1.
- Acme Security Lead must approve who holds the escalation and de-escalation requester roles (Security & GRC consult — see §6).
- R3 depends on On-Call Management being licensed; confirm with Acme licensing before R3 scoping.

## 3. Functional Architecture

### 3.1 End-to-end process flow

![Figure 1 — Agent-side escalation flow](diagrams/fig-01-escalation-flow.svg)

*Figure 1 — Agent-side escalation flow: the agent's Escalate Case submission creates the Escalation record; approval follows where the escalation template requires it, the watch list is emailed on each update, and the updates are replicated to the case's work notes. Source: `diagrams/fig-01-escalation-flow.drawio` (Diagramming Specialist).*

### 3.2 User journeys per persona

**sn_customerservice_agent** — primary journey: identifies a case requiring senior attention, opens it, selects the Escalate Case related link, fills in Reason, Escalation Justification and the escalation template on the Escalation form, adds the duty manager to the watch list, and submits. Continues working other cases.

**Regional duty manager** (a `sys_user`: the manager of the case's assignment group, `assignment_group.manager` *(citation: `markdown/platform-administration/user-administration/t_CreateAGroup.md`)*) — primary journey: receives the escalation's email notifications as a watch-list member. Opens the case — and the escalation record, subject to the read-access check in §6.1 — reviews the work notes, takes action (assigns to themselves, reassigns, etc.).

**sn_customerservice_manager** — observational journey: reviews escalation patterns via case work notes during weekly team retrospectives (R1); shifts to Performance Analytics dashboards in R2.

### 3.3 Module and feature mapping

| Capability | ServiceNow product / module | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Case management | CSM (sn_customerservice) baseline | No customisation. |
| Escalation workflow | The case and account escalation feature: Escalate Case related link, Escalation form, escalation templates and severities | Baseline feature; no new scoped app. |
| Audit trail | The Escalation record and the case's work notes | Baseline. No custom table per §1.1. |
| Duty manager | The case assignment group's manager, added to the watch list by the agent (R1) → On-Call Management (R3) | Baseline field R1; Now Platform On-Call Management R3. |
| Notification | Email to the current user and the watch list on each escalation update | Baseline *(citation: `markdown/customer-service-management/case-escalation-process.md`)*. |
| Reporting | Performance Analytics (R2 only — out of R1 scope) | Baseline. |

---

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Data model summary

No new tables. No new fields. No new scoped app. The programme uses:

- `sn_customerservice_case` (baseline) — case record; it keeps its baseline state, and the submission raises an Escalation record [`sn_customerservice_escalation`] against it *(citation: `markdown/customer-service-management/case-escalation-components.md`)*.
- `sn_customerservice_case.work_notes` (baseline journal) — receives the escalation's updates, replicated as work notes *(citation: `markdown/customer-service-management/case-escalation-form.md`)*.
- `sys_user_group.manager` (baseline) — duty manager resolution for R1.

The underlying Technical Designer spec, *Acme CSM Case Escalation Button — Technical Design* (`clients/acme/csm/case-escalation-button-technical-design.md`), designed a bespoke button, Business Rule and modal; per OD-01 it is re-issued as configuration of the baseline feature — escalation templates, severities, role assignments and notifications.

### 4.2 Integration architecture

**None in R1.** Email notifications use the platform's baseline email channel. No external systems integrated.

R3 introduces an internal dependency on On-Call Management (not an external integration).

### 4.3 Environment topology

Standard Acme topology: Dev → SIT → UAT → Prod. Update sets carry configuration on the tables that track customizations — those with the update_synch attribute — and exclude task or process data; data records move by an instance-to-instance import *(citation: `markdown/application-development/system-update-sets/customizations-tracked-update-sets.md`)*. Whether the escalation templates, severities and role assignments are tracked or move as data is checked on the instance before the release plan is fixed.

### 4.4 Performance and scaling

R1 volume: ~3,500 cases/month × estimated 5% escalation rate = ~175 escalations/month, ~6/day. No async strategy required for R1 at this volume.

R2 reporting may need indicator pre-aggregation at higher case volumes — flagged as a Performance & Scale consult for R2 planning.

**Routing-time consult flag:** Performance & Scale Specialist — **does not fire** for R1 at this volume.

---

## 5. Integrations

**None in R1.** R3 introduces On-Call Management — a Now Platform internal integration, not an external system. Detailed design deferred to R3 scoping.

---

## 6. Security & Compliance

### 6.1 Role model

| Role | Capabilities | Source |
|---|---|---|
| sn_customerservice_agent | Uses the Escalate Case related link; requests escalations; reads the case's work notes. | Baseline CSM role, with `sn_customerservice.escalation_requester` to request an escalation *(citation: `markdown/customer-service-management/escalate-csm-case.md`)*. |
| sn_customerservice_manager | Requests escalations for any case they read; reads the team's escalation records — to be verified on the instance: the corpus describes the requester role only as able to request, and gives viewing all escalation records to the Escalation Configuration Viewer role (`sn_crm_escalation_config_viewer`) *(citation: `markdown/customer-service-management/case-escalation-components.md`)*. | Baseline CSM role, with `sn_customerservice.escalation_requester`. |
| Regional duty manager | Receives the escalation's notifications as a watch-list member (R1); de-escalates the case when its cause is resolved (R4). | The case assignment group's manager (`sys_user_group.manager`), added to the watch list by the agent. R1 needs no role for the notifications — whether a watch-list member can open the escalation record without an escalation role is verified on the instance; R4 needs `sn_customerservice.deescalation_requester`, which de-escalating requires and which contains the requester role *(citations: `markdown/customer-service-management/de-escalate-csm-case.md`, `markdown/customer-service-management/case-escalation-components.md`)*. |

### 6.2 Data classification and handling

Customer-supplied case content (subject, description, the escalation's justification) is treated per Acme's existing CSM content-handling policy. **No new content classes are introduced by this programme** — the Escalation Justification captures the same kind of content as the existing case description.

### 6.3 Audit, logging, compliance

Audit trail lives on baseline records: the Escalation record keeps the reason, the justification and its state (Requested, Escalated, Declined, and Closed once de-escalated), and its updates are replicated to the case's activity history as work notes *(citations: `markdown/customer-service-management/case-escalation-form.md`, `markdown/customer-service-management/de-escalate-csm-case.md`)*.

Work notes are immutable by default in baseline ServiceNow — agents cannot retroactively edit posted notes. This satisfies Acme's internal audit requirement without a separate log table.

### 6.4 Privacy considerations

The escalation's justification may contain customer-identifiable information. Acme's existing CSM PII handling policy applies — no programme-level deviation.

**Routing-time consult flag:** Security & GRC Specialist — **fires** on who holds the escalation and de-escalation requester roles. Consult requested before sign-off.

## 7. Operations

### 7.1 Support model and SLAs

R1 inherits the existing CSM support model. No new support tiers introduced.

### 7.2 Monitoring and alerting

The Escalation records and their states are the operational view. No custom monitoring required for R1.

### 7.3 Backup, restore, DR

Inherits baseline ServiceNow backup posture. No new data stores.

### 7.4 Runbook references

The following runbooks are **planned**, to be authored by Operational Documentation:

- **RB-CSM-ESC-01** — How an agent uses the Escalate Case related link (procedure).
- **RB-CSM-ESC-02** — How a duty manager processes an escalation notification (procedure).
- **RB-CSM-ESC-03** — Troubleshooting: the case's assignment group has no manager to add to the watch list (resolution).

KBAs planned:
- **KBA-CSM-ESC-01** — Agent-facing: when and how to escalate a case.

These are downstream handoff items — see §9.

---

## 8. Open Decisions

### OD-01: How an escalation is recorded

- **Context:** The story references state="Escalated". The case states the Case API documents are New (1), Open (10), Awaiting Info (18), Resolved (6) and Closed (3); there is no "Escalated" state *(citation: `markdown/api-reference/rest-apis/case-api.md`)*. The case and account escalation feature records an escalation as its own record instead *(citation: `markdown/customer-service-management/case-escalation-components.md`)*.
- **Options:**
  1. **The baseline escalation feature** — the agent raises an Escalation [`sn_customerservice_escalation`] against the case, shaped by Escalation Templates and Escalation Severity, under the `sn_customerservice.escalation_requester` role; `sn_customerservice.deescalation_requester` covers R4. The case keeps its baseline state. No custom object.
  2. Keep "Open" and add a field `u_is_escalated` (boolean) on the case — a custom field the baseline record makes unnecessary; rejected.
  3. Repurpose "Awaiting Info" (state=18) as "Escalated" — semantic mismatch; rejected.
  4. Add "Escalated" as a new choice on `sn_customerservice_case.state` — a custom state-model extension under §1.1, which option 1 makes unnecessary; rejected.
- **Recommendation:** Option 1. It is baseline, so no §1.1 approval is needed; the CSM Specialist confirms that the escalation templates fit Acme's duty-manager routing.
- **Owner:** CSM Specialist (baseline fit) + Acme CSM Practice Lead (business).
- **Decision by:** before R1 sprint start.
- **Status:** Open — awaiting the CSM Specialist's confirmation of the baseline fit; no §1.1 ruling is needed.

### OD-02: Notification channel scope

- **Context:** R1 uses email only. Acme operations also use MS Teams.
- **Options:**
  1. Email only in R1 (current default).
  2. Email + Teams in R1.
- **Recommendation:** Option 1 for R1. Teams integration deferred to R2 or beyond — adds dependency on Microsoft Graph integration.
- **Owner:** Acme CSM Programme Director.
- **Decision by:** sprint 1 of R1.
- **Status:** Open.

### OD-03: Restrict escalation to specific priority levels?

- **Context:** Story does not specify a priority filter on escalation requests.
- **Options:**
  1. Available on all cases regardless of priority.
  2. Available only on P1 and P2 cases.
- **Recommendation:** Option 1 (broader availability) with R2 reporting capturing the priority mix for later policy refinement.
- **Owner:** Acme CSM Practice Lead.
- **Decision by:** sprint 1 of R1.
- **Status:** Open.

---

## 9. Downstream handoff manifest

- **Technical Designer** — re-issues the R1 component spec as configuration of the baseline escalation feature (OD-01); will produce R2/R3/R4 component specs separately.
- **Developer** — not required for R1: the baseline feature is configured, not built.
- **Flow Designer Specialist** — not required: escalation approval uses the template's approval subflow, and R4 uses the baseline De-escalate action *(citations: `markdown/customer-service-management/case-escalation-process.md`, `markdown/customer-service-management/de-escalate-csm-case.md`)*.
- **Integration Specialist** — not required for R1; required for R3 if On-Call Management requires bespoke integration.
- **Operational Documentation** — authors RB-CSM-ESC-01..03 and KBA-CSM-ESC-01.
- **Security & GRC Specialist** — consult on the escalation role assignments before sign-off.
- **Reporting & Analytics Specialist** — R2 only; out of R1 scope.

## 10. Baseline-first audit

| Item | Count | Approval status |
|---|---|---|
| Custom tables proposed | 0 | n/a |
| New scoped apps proposed | 0 | n/a |
| Custom state values proposed | 0 | n/a — OD-01 recommends the baseline Escalation record. |
| Custom Connection Aliases proposed | 0 | n/a |
| Custom CMDB CI Classes proposed | 0 | n/a |

**Compliance status:** **COMPLIANT.** No custom objects: OD-01 recommends the baseline case and account escalation feature over a new state value.
```

### §6.2 post-build manifest

> *Design document produced. Proposing review by the named reviewers (Chief Architect, Acme CSM Practice Lead, Acme Security Lead) before approval — confirm reviewers and dispatch for review?*
>
> **Open dependency — CSM Specialist confirmation required:**
>
> - **OD-01** — the HLD recommends the baseline Escalation record over a new state value; the CSM Specialist confirms the fit before downstream design (the Technical Designer's R1 re-issue and R2/R3/R4) proceeds.
>
> **Downstream handoffs once OD-01 is resolved:**
>
> 1. **Operational Documentation** — author RB-CSM-ESC-01..03 and KBA-CSM-ESC-01 before R1 go-live.
> 2. **Security & GRC Specialist** — consult on the escalation role assignments before sign-off.
>
> **No Code Reviewer trigger** — this artefact is a design document, not code.

### Explanation

This HLD demonstrates three disciplines specific to this skill:

1. **Baseline-first audit block at the end of the document.** Section 10 lists all custom objects referenced in the design, with each one's approval status. The block makes governance compliance auditable rather than implicit. In this case it lists no custom object: the "Escalated" state the story asked for is answered by the baseline Escalation record (OD-01), and the audit block says so.

2. **OD-01 weighs the baseline first.** The Open Decision section doesn't pretend the "Escalated" state is a settled question. It evaluates the baseline case and account escalation feature before any custom option, finds that it covers R1 and R4, and records why a new field or state value would be custom work the baseline makes unnecessary. A custom option that survived that test would go to the Chief Architect as an `OPEN QUESTION — CUSTOM OBJECT PROPOSAL`.

3. **§6.2 manifest is multi-track.** The manifest has an open dependency (the CSM Specialist's confirmation of OD-01), downstream handoffs (Operational Documentation, Security & GRC), and explicitly notes no Code Reviewer trigger. The post-build hook respects that HLD outputs are documents, not code.

The HLD itself is also valuable as a counter-pattern — earlier in the engagement, the Technical Designer defaulted to a custom audit table. This HLD's §4.1 (Data model summary) makes the no-custom-table commitment first-class and visible to the review board, locking in the architectural decision rather than allowing it to drift across releases.

| Version | Date | Author | Change |

## Component 1: SLABreachRiskClient (Script Include)

### 1.1 Purpose

Client-callable wrapper around the existing `x_acme_itsm.SLABreachRiskCalculator` Script Include. Exposes the `calculateRisk(incidentSysId)` method to GlideAjax-based callers from client-side scripts in the Incident form within Service Operations Workspace.

### 1.2 Scope decision

`x_acme_itsm` — existing scoped app, pre-approved. No new scope required.

### 1.3 Data model

No fields. No tables. Script Include only.

### 1.4 Access control

The Script Include itself is `client_callable: true`. The body enforces `gs.hasRole('itil')` before delegation; non-itil callers receive `null` and the calling Client Script renders a "—" badge.

| Access path | Role check | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| GlideAjax from authenticated itil session | `gs.hasRole('itil')` passes | Delegation to SLABreachRiskCalculator |
| GlideAjax from authenticated non-itil session | `gs.hasRole('itil')` fails | Returns null |
| Unauthenticated request | Platform-level authentication required before reaching Script Include | Returns 401 at platform layer |

### 1.5 Server-side logic

| Item | Type | Function signature | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SLABreachRiskClient.calculateRisk` | client_callable method | `calculateRisk(): string (JSON)` — reads `sysparm_incident_sysid` from `this.getParameter()`, validates format, delegates to `x_acme_itsm.SLABreachRiskCalculator.calculateRisk(sysid)`, JSON-stringifies the result. | Client cannot invoke a non-client-callable Script Include. The wrapper is the minimum needed to expose the calculator safely. |

Function body is the Developer's deliverable. Function signature, role check, and parameter validation are documented here for Developer guidance.

### 1.6 Client-side logic

Not applicable.

### 1.7 Flow outline

Not applicable.

### 1.8 Integration touchpoints

Not applicable.

### 1.9 Notifications

Not applicable.

### 1.10 Test strategy

| Test ID | Coverage | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| ATF-SLABRC-01 | Happy path: itil caller, valid sys_id | ATF + impersonation, assert JSON contains risk/score/basis. |
| ATF-SLABRC-02 | Role guard: non-itil caller | ATF + impersonation, assert response is null. |
| ATF-SLABRC-03 | Input validation: invalid sys_id format | ATF, assert response is null (or error JSON per spec). |
| ATF-SLABRC-04 | Delegation: assert calculateRisk delegates to x_acme_itsm.SLABreachRiskCalculator | ATF + spy pattern if available, else manual verification. |

### 1.11 Configuration items checklist

- None — the Script Include is self-contained within `x_acme_itsm`.

### 1.12 Open decisions

- **OD-LLD-01:** Should the wrapper cache results within a single GlideAjax request? Currently no — each call hits SLABreachRiskCalculator. Decision: defer to Performance & Scale consult.

---

## Component 2: SLA Risk Badge (Client Script)

### 2.1 Purpose

onLoad Client Script on the `incident` table that calls `SLABreachRiskClient.calculateRisk` via GlideAjax and renders the SLA Risk badge in Service Operations Workspace.

### 2.2 Scope decision

`x_acme_itsm` — existing scoped app.

### 2.3 Data model

Not applicable.

### 2.4 Access control

Inherited from baseline `incident` table view ACLs. The badge is render-time only; no data is mutated by the Client Script.

### 2.5 Server-side logic

Not applicable.

### 2.6 Client-side logic

| Item | Type | Table | When | Condition | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SLA Risk Badge` | Client Script (onLoad) | incident | onLoad | `g_form.getValue('sys_id')` is set | Renders a placeholder badge immediately, dispatches GlideAjax asynchronously, updates the badge on AJAX completion. Failure renders "—" with tooltip. |

### 2.7 Flow outline

Not applicable.

### 2.8 Integration touchpoints

Not applicable.

### 2.9 Notifications

Not applicable.

### 2.10 Test strategy

| Test ID | Coverage | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| ATF-SLABRB-01 | Badge renders on form load | ATF, assert DOM contains badge with non-empty content. |
| ATF-SLABRB-02 | High-risk render | ATF + mocked GlideAjax response score=75, assert badge color and label. |
| ATF-SLABRB-03 | Low-risk render | ATF + mocked GlideAjax response score=25, assert badge color and label. |
| ATF-SLABRB-04 | Service unavailable | ATF + mocked GlideAjax failure, assert badge shows "—" and tooltip "Risk unavailable". |
| ATF-SLABRB-05 | Performance — p95 render time < 200ms | Load test in lower env, ~50 concurrent form opens. |

### 2.11 Configuration items checklist

- None — the Client Script is self-contained within `x_acme_itsm`.

### 2.12 Open decisions

- **OD-LLD-02:** Confirm with Acme UI/UX Lead whether SOW exposes a reusable badge component or whether the Client Script uses inline HTML rendering. Affects implementation only; design unchanged.

## Baseline-first audit

| Item | Count | Approval status |

| Custom state values proposed | 0 | n/a |

- **ATF Author** — implements the 9 test cases listed in §1.10 and §2.10.
- **UI/UX Specialist** — consult on OD-LLD-02 (SOW badge component pattern) before Developer implementation.
- **Performance & Scale Specialist** — consult on OD-LLD-01 (caching strategy).
```

### §6.2 post-build manifest

> *Design document produced. Proposing review by Acme ITSM Practice Lead and Acme UI/UX Lead before approval — confirm reviewers and dispatch for review?*
>
> **Downstream handoffs:**
>
> 1. **Developer** — implementation of `SLABreachRiskClient` and `SLA Risk Badge` per the LLD.
> 2. **ATF Author** — 9 test cases for ATF coverage.
> 3. **UI/UX Specialist** — consult on OD-LLD-02.
> 4. **Performance & Scale Specialist** — consult on OD-LLD-01.
>
> **Baseline-first audit: COMPLIANT.** No new custom objects.
>
> **No Code Reviewer trigger** — this artefact is a design document, not code.

### Explanation

This LLD demonstrates the per-component structure (one component per major header section), with each component getting all 12 sub-sections in order — even when most are "Not applicable" (the Client Script has no data model, no server-side logic, no integrations, no notifications).

The strictness is intentional. Empty sections force the writer to confirm absence is intentional, not an oversight. The Developer reads this document and trusts that "Not applicable" means the design has been considered and rejected, not skipped.

The Baseline-first audit shows COMPLIANT — all work fits within the pre-approved `x_acme_itsm` scope. This contrasts with Example 1's PENDING status; the audit format is the same but the substance differs, and both are visible to reviewers.

The §6.2 manifest is shorter than Example 1's because there are no blocking §1.1 dependencies, just clean downstream handoffs.

## 1. Process purpose and outcome

The Customer Service Major Incident Process ensures that a single customer-impacting service issue affecting 5 or more cases is recognised, escalated, communicated, and resolved as a coordinated effort rather than as independent case work.

**Outcome:** the customer-facing impact window is minimised and a single Major Incident record is the source of truth for customer communications and post-incident review.

## 2. Roles and responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| CSM Agent | Flag potential MI when a third independent customer reports the same symptom. |
| Duty Manager | Validate the MI flag; declare a Major Incident on confirmation. |
| MIM Coordinator | Run the MI bridge, coordinate technical teams, drive customer comms. |
| Customer Service Manager | Approve customer comms; sign off on MI closure. |

## 3. Process flow

## 4. Triggers

The process initiates when a CSM Agent observes a third independent case with matching symptoms. The "3 cases" threshold is the operational definition of a pattern in Acme's CSM practice.

## 5. Steps

(Numbered list of steps with role, action, system, decision points — abbreviated for brevity.)

## 6. Exceptions and escalations

- If the duty manager is unavailable, the agent escalates to the on-call senior agent per the existing on-call rota.
- If the MIM Coordinator is unavailable, the duty manager assumes the coordinator role.

## 7. Inputs and outputs per step

(Per-step IO table — abbreviated for brevity.)

## 8. Measurements

| KPI | Target |
|---|---|
| Time to MI declaration from third case | < 30 minutes |
| Customer-facing comms latency from MI declaration | < 15 minutes |
| MI closure latency from resolution | < 60 minutes |

These are tracked via Performance Analytics on the case records: the major case and its child cases in CSM Major issue management *(citation: `markdown/customer-service-management/major-issue-management.md`)*.

## Baseline-first audit

| Item | Count | Approval status |
|---|---|---|
| Custom tables proposed | 0 | n/a |
| New scoped apps proposed | 0 | n/a |
| Custom state values proposed | 0 | n/a |
| Custom Connection Aliases proposed | 0 | n/a |

**Compliance status: COMPLIANT.** The process uses baseline Major Incident Management constructs entirely.

## Downstream handoff manifest

- **Operational Documentation** — KBA-CSM-MI-01, RB-CSM-MI-01.
- **Reporting & Analytics Specialist** — Performance Analytics indicators for the three KPIs in §8.
- **Discovery Specialist** — follow-up workshop scheduled (date TBC) for the post-incident review section refinement.
```

### Explanation

The PDD format is markedly different from HLD/LLD — process-oriented, swimlane diagrams, RACI rather than ACL matrices. The audience is operations, not architecture.

Even so, the **Baseline-first audit block is present** — every artefact this skill produces includes it, regardless of audience. This is a deliberate discipline: governance compliance is auditable in every document type.

The PDD also doesn't propose new technical components; it ratifies the existing baseline Major Incident Management constructs as the process spine. No Technical Designer or Developer handoff is required from this document — only Operational Documentation and Reporting & Analytics Specialist follow-ups.
