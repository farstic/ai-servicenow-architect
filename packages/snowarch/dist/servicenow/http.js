/**
 * The one place this package makes an HTTP request.
 *
 * Node's global `fetch` ignores `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` entirely (R-15).
 * That is not a bug — WHATWG fetch says nothing about proxy variables — but it means a laptop
 * on a corporate network gets `fetch failed` from a client that never tried the proxy, while
 * `curl` to the same URL works, which reads as "the tool is broken".
 *
 * `undici` is the same implementation Node bundles, published separately so a dispatcher can be
 * attached. `EnvHttpProxyAgent` reads the proxy variables **when it is constructed**, which is
 * why `env-sanitise.ts` runs first at both entry points and why the agent is built lazily here
 * rather than at module load: a test that sets `HTTPS_PROXY` and then imports this module would
 * otherwise be configuring an agent that already exists.
 *
 * `grep -rn "\bfetch(" src` is expected to show only this file. That is criterion 7, and the
 * reason for it is that a second call site is a second place where proxy support silently does
 * not apply — and it would fail only on the machines least able to debug it.

         * where E-26 reported no proxy configured: the warning was printed anyway, because the agent was
         * built unconditionally. A machine with no proxy was being warned about a proxy feature it was
         * not using.
         *
         * The fix is the condition, NOT a suppressed warning. `process.noDeprecation`, a
         * `--no-warnings` flag or a `warning` listener would hide every other warning Node has to give
         * us, including ones about the code we are about to ship. On a machine that IS proxied the agent
         * is built and the warning prints — that one is true, and it names the feature actually in use.
         *
         * `connect` keeps its own arm: it is the test seam for a custom `lookup`, and a test that sets
         * it with no proxy still needs a dispatcher that honours it. `Agent` is undici's ordinary pooling
         * dispatcher and is not experimental, so that arm prints nothing either.

 *
 * `connect` is the same escape hatch, for the same audience: undici passes these straight to
 * `net.connect`, so a test can supply its own `lookup` and make a name fail to resolve WITHOUT
 * asking the machine's resolver. That matters because the alternative — pointing a test at a
 * name that "cannot resolve" — is a test that depends on the network it is trying not to use, and
 * it failed exactly that way on a macOS runner where something answered for a `.invalid` host.
 *
 * Passing nothing clears both, so the seam cannot leak from one test into the next: the existing
 * `afterEach` calls this with no arguments and gets the production agent back for free.
