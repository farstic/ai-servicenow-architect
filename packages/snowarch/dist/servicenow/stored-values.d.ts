/**
 * What the platform STORED, compared with what was SENT (ARC-09-C93).
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. A string longer than its column is, on the evidence, not refused: the Table API stores
 * the first N characters, answers 2xx, and echoes the cut value (`docs/PLATFORM-NOTES.md` PN-07,
 * observed on `sys_script_fix.name` with a POST; the owner's live test, finding R4, reported a
 * Business Rule name cut at 40). Most tools then built their success line from the ARGUMENT —
 * "Created business rule <the long name>" — so the report agreed with the request instead of the
 * record. The premise that `sys_script` and a PATCH behave the same is ASSUMED, not seen; the
 * procedure that settles it is in `packages/snowarch/tests/live/README.md`.
 *
 * THE DESIGN, in three parts, each chosen from what was measured:
 *
 *   1. DETECT from the write's own response. `createRecord` and `updateRecord` return the platform's
 *      record, and no tool compares it with what it sent. Comparing costs no request. The comparison
 *      lives where every tool already passes: `routeToolInvocation` wraps the client for one
 *      invocation (`withWriteVerification`), so a tool needs no edit for the check to cover it.
 *      Detection is CPU only and runs inside the write, so the write's latency is the write's.
 *
 *   2. CONFIRM AND NAME THE LIMIT, afterwards and only if something was cut. When the tool has
 *      finished — returned or thrown — `settle` reads `sys_dictionary.max_length` for the cut columns:
 *      one request per TABLE, one total budget, and the first failed lookup stops the rest (a failed
 *      login that is repeated is how an account is locked). Nothing is read before a write. The only
 *      other dictionary reader in the server (`snow_disco_table_discover`) turns a blank limit into
 *      255, keys its cache by table without the instance, and does not walk inherited columns, so a
 *      limit taken from it BEFORE a write could refuse a valid write. Here a wrong limit can mislabel
 *      a warning or, below, hide one; it can never block a write.
 *
 *   3. REPORT in the tool's result as `warnings`, and on the error of a tool that throws after it
 *      wrote. The server cannot stop the cut — by the time the response says so, the record exists.
 *      Refusing BEFORE the write needs the limit first; PN-10 lists what that needs and why it waits.
 *
 * WHAT THE DICTIONARY IS ALLOWED TO DO. `max_length` is "a logical limit for the size of string
 * fields" (`vendor/ServiceNowDocs/markdown/platform-administration/table-administration-and-data-management/r_DictionaryEntryForm.md`),
 * and the page says the system maps it to a physical type with more length available than stated. So
 * "the platform cuts at exactly `max_length`" is not documented in the bundled corpus — verify on the
 * instance; the live run confirms it for `sys_script.name` only. The warning therefore says what the
 * dictionary STATES, never that the column "holds" it. The dictionary may:
 *   - confirm a cut (`confirmed: true`) when the stored value fits the limit and the sent one did not;
 *   - suppress a warning when the limit fits the sent value under BOTH ways of counting characters
 *     (code points and UTF-16 units; which one the platform uses is not documented — verify), because
 *     then something other than the column shortened the value, usually a normalisation;
 *   - suppress a warning when the STORED value is longer than the limit, which proves the limit did
 *     not cut it (a sanitiser removed a tail from an HTML field).
 * It cannot answer for a column defined on a PARENT table (`incident.short_description` is defined
 * on `task`): there is no row under the child's name, so those warnings stay `confirmed: false`, and
 * a benign normalisation on such a column is not suppressed. That is a known gap (PN-10).
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE. Only `createRecord` and `updateRecord` are checked. Not checked:
 * `batchRequest` (`snow_fluent_request_batch`), `uploadAttachment`, `createChangeRequest`, the Now
 * Assist and catalogue POSTs, and a client copy made with `withUser`. Only STRING values are compared.
 * A field the response does not echo (a journal field, a password, a column the account can write but
 * not read) can never warn, so an absent `warnings` key is not proof that nothing was cut.
 *
 * FALSE ALARMS ARE THE OTHER FAILURE. A warning raised for a decimal that lost its trailing zero
 * teaches the reader to skip the one that matters, so the signature is narrow: both values are
 * strings, the stored one is non-empty and strictly shorter, it is a PREFIX of what was sent once line
 * endings are normalised, and what is gone contains something other than whitespace and is not just a
 * decimal's trailing zeros. Reformats that drop a tail and are NOT exempt — a datetime written to a
 * date column, a trailing list delimiter, a sanitised HTML tail — do warn unless the dictionary rules
 * them out; `tests/servicenow/stored-values.test.ts` names the ones it knows.
