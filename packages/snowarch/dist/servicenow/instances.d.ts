/**
 * The instance manager: one store, one precedence, and a report of what happened.
 *
 * Before ARC-04-S02 there were four configuration sources and the legacy wizard store
 * returned EARLY, overriding env-defined instances — the override was documented by a
 * test rather than intended (P-21). Now there is one store module, one precedence, and
 * `load()` returns a LoadReport so the caller can say what was loaded, what was refused
 * and why, instead of the server guessing from an empty instance map.
 *
 * Flag SEMANTICS — how a flag gates a tool — are ARC-04-S03. This module only loads.
