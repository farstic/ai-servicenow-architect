/**
 * One JSON line per mutating call, in a file inside the checkout.
 *
 * §2.1 says a write needs "write approved" from the user. Before this, that was provable only
 * from a conversation transcript — which the reviewer asking the question does not have. The
 * audit file is what makes the claim checkable afterwards by someone who was not there.
 *
 * What a line may NOT contain is the whole design. Never a payload: `fields`, `data`, `script`
 * and the response body are all excluded, because an audit trail that records what was written
 * becomes a second copy of client data sitting in a git checkout. Never a credential. Never an
 * instance URL — the label is enough to identify which instance, and a URL in a file that gets
 * pasted into a ticket is an unnecessary disclosure.
 *
 * `query` IS recorded, and that is a deliberate exception: a query is the filter that selected
 * the records, it can contain personal data (`caller_id=…`), and without it a line saying
 * "updated some incidents" answers nothing. The engine already had that string in its
 * transcript. The README says so.
