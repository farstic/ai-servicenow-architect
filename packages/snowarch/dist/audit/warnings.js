/**
 * What a warning may leave behind in the audit trail (ARC-09-C101, b).
 *
 * A write whose result carries `warnings[]` succeeded, and the trail used to record it as a plain
 * `ok`. The line now carries the warning CODES, the table, the field names and a count — and
 * nothing a caller typed. Everything else a warning holds is dropped on purpose: the message and the
 * lengths are for the person reading the result, the sys_id is already in the line's own `sysId`,
 * and an audit file that grew a free-text slot would be a payload channel (the writer's header, and
 * the no-secrets sweep that found `args.name` in a `note`).
 *
 * Every string that survives is checked against a shape. A `code` must be one the registry knows —
 * a code is server-built, so a value the registry has never heard of is not one of ours. A table or
 * field name must look like an identifier; one that does not is not recorded (the table as `null`,
 * the field not at all) while the warning is still counted. A field in a warning is a column the
 * platform echoed back, which already limits it to real column names; the pattern is the second
 * line, not the first.
