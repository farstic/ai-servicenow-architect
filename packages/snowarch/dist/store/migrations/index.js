/**
 * Store schema migrations — explicit, versioned, backed up, and never near a credential.
 *
 * ARC-09-S06. The old server (`src/cli/config-store.ts`) migrated per-instance fields silently on
 * every load and swallowed a parse error by returning an empty config, which is two bad ideas
 * wearing one coat: a user whose file was mistyped was told they had no instances, and a user who
 * pulled a new version had their credential file rewritten by a process they never started. This
 * module is the replacement, and its shape is a reaction to both:
 *
 *   **Nothing migrates on load.** The server reads the version, and if it is not this build's it
 *   refuses to start configured — with `STORE_SCHEMA_OUTDATED` and the command to run. Migrating
 *   is a thing a person asks for.
 *
 *   **A parse error is a hard error.** `STORE_UNREADABLE`, with the path, and the file is left
 *   exactly as it was. "Return empty" is how a store with one typo becomes a store with nothing.
 *
 *   **A backup before every write**, 0600, byte-identical to the input, named for the moment it
 *   was taken. Restoring is `store restore`, not a rescue operation.
 *
 *   **Credential values are never touched.** Not by policy — by a test that deep-compares the
 *   `auth` subtree of every instance before and after, over a deep-frozen input, on every
 *   migration in the registry. A migration that touches `auth` fails the suite; it cannot ship.
 *
 * The registry is EMPTY at 2.0.0 and `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` is 1. That is deliberate: the
 * framework exists before the first migration so that whoever changes the schema is forced
 * through it — the contiguity test refuses a `MIGRATIONS` array that does not end exactly at
 * `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`, so a bumped constant with no migration is a failing build.
