/**
 * The doctor's probes: ARC-07-S03's implementation, adapted to ARC-04-S12's declaration.
 *
 * Two signatures existed for one job — the doctor declared `runAll(instanceLabel)` before the
 * probes were written, and the probes landed as `probeAll(client, options)`. Adapting them in ONE
 * place is the whole point of this file: a check that built its own client would be a second
 * answer to "how do we authenticate a probe", and the first thing such an answer loses is
 * `maxRetries: 0` — the rule that stops a 401 becoming three.
 *
 * WHAT THIS NEVER DOES IS WRITE. The wizard records `lastProbe` in the store; the doctor reads and
 * reports. A doctor that wrote its findings would change the file it is diagnosing, and a user
 * comparing two runs could not tell which changes were theirs.
