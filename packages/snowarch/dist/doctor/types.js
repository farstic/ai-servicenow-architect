/**
 * The registry contract, shared with ARC-08's unified doctor.
 *
 * Two doctors exist by design: this one owns the checks only the server package can perform —
 * the store's schema and modes, the flag rules, a real stdio handshake against itself — and
 * ARC-08's owns the engine's. The alternative was ARC-08 re-implementing the flag rules in a
 * second language, which is P-16: two implementations of one rule diverge, and the one users
 * see is the one that is wrong.
 *
 * Ids are `SV-xx` from the first commit. `01` §8 called them `S-xx`, which collides with the
 * spike ids `S-01`…`S-26` in `03`, and ARC-08-S01 had a planned rename step to fix that later.
 * Shipping the final ids now makes that step a no-op, and they live in ONE exported constant so
 * a future re-home is a single line.
