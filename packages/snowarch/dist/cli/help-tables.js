/**
 * ARC-08-C22 — the sub-command tables, and the one function that lays them out.
 *
 * A DEPENDENCY-FREE MODULE, and that is the whole reason it exists rather than a tidiness
 * argument. `./snowarch instance --help` used to list one sub-command of nine, because the frame
 * in `tools/snowarch/lib/instance.mjs` keeps its own text: the frame runs in design-only, where
 * `node_modules` is absent, and `cli/instance-command.js` reaches `zod` and `undici` through its
 * import graph. So the lines are generated into the frame by `scripts/gen-cli-help.mjs` — and that
 * generator has to run on a clone with no dependencies too, which `tests/gen-all.test.mjs` asserts.
 *
 * This file imports nothing. Both dispatchers read their table from here, both help texts lay it
 * out with the same function, and the generator reads the same two tables — one definition, four
 * readers, and none of them can drag a dependency into a place that has none.
