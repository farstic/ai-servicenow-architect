/**
 * ARC-07-S01 — the only place a secret is typed, and everything that keeps it there.
 *
 * `01` principle 3: the terminal is the one surface where a password can be entered without a
 * transcript, an argv entry or a file to forget about. That makes this file the credential
 * boundary, and its rules follow from what goes wrong when each is missing:
 *
 *   NOTHING IS ECHOED         — not the characters, not asterisks (asterisks reveal the length,
 *                               which is why `SNOWARCH_MASK=asterisk` exists and is off).
 *   RAW MODE IS ALWAYS RESTORED — including when the caller throws. A terminal left raw is a
 *                               shell that no longer echoes anything the user types afterwards.
 *   NO TTY IS A REFUSAL       — never a silent read of a pipe. A password read from an
 *                               unexpected stdin is a password in a CI log.
 *   THE ARGV SCAN IS ELSEWHERE — `cli/index.ts`, before commander sees anything (P-34).
 *
 * No dependency: `@inquirer/prompts` is what ARC-04-S01 removed (P-23), and re-adding a prompt
 * library for four functions would put the credential boundary inside somebody else's package.
 * `node:readline` and `node:process` only.
