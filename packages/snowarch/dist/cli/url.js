/**
 * ARC-07-S02 — what counts as an instance address, and what the wizard will not guess.
 *
 * P-23 is the whole reason this file has rules rather than a regex. The wizard it replaces
 * "helpfully" turned `https://acme.service-now.com/api` into a base URL of `https://acme
 * .service-now.com/api` and saved it — after which every REST path was `/api/api/now/table/…`
 * and nothing worked, with no error that mentioned the URL. So: a path is REFUSED with the
 * reason, never repaired silently; a bare word is PROPOSED and shown before it is accepted
 * (principle 10); and a URL with credentials in it is refused outright, because a password in a
 * URL is a password in the store, in a log and in a shell history.
 *
 * The environment is the other half. `dev12345.service-now.com` is a PDI and the wizard says so;
 * anything else is ASKED, never guessed, because the environment decides which preset a write is
 * checked against — and `dev12345.service-now.com.evil.example` ends in a domain somebody else
 * owns.
