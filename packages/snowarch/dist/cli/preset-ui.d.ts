 * changes the RECOMMENDATION TEXT on that line and never the toggle — because a probe is a
 * reading of the instance at one moment, and a wizard that silently turned a flag off on the
 * strength of one would produce an installation the user did not choose and cannot explain.
 *
 * Production is capped at `read-only` here with no override at all. Raising it is a separate,
 * named step in a different command (`set-preset --ack-prod`, ARC-07-S06), which is the point:
 * the moment you can raise production inside a wizard, raising production becomes something that
 * happens while you are doing something else.
