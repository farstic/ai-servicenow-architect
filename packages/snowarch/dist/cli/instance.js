/**
 * ARC-07-S05 — `instance add`, end to end.
 *
 * This file COMPOSES; it does not decide. The URL rules are S02's, the masked prompt is S01's, the
 * probes are S03's, the review screen is S04's, and the store write is ARC-04-S02's. What is new
 * here is the ORDER, the exit paths, and one rule that only exists where they meet:
 *
 *   NOTHING IS SAVED UNTIL THE `Applying:` LINE, AND THERE IS NO "SAVE ANYWAY".
 *
 * P-23's wizard offered exactly that, and an instance saved through it failed later inside a tool
 * call with no memory of the moment somebody clicked past a warning. Every refusal here ends with
 * `Nothing saved.` and an exit code, and the store file is untouched on every one of them.
 *
 * The second rule is the credential loop: THREE ATTEMPTS, ONE REQUEST EACH, shared between a wrong
 * password and a missing role. A fourth attempt is an account closer to a lockout on an instance
 * whose policy nobody here knows.

// Seven sub-commands that all begin the same way: resolve the store THE WAY THE SERVER DOES, load
// it, find the label. That preamble is `openStore` + `findInstance` below and exists once, because
// a second resolver is how the wizard writes one file and the server reads another.
//
// What each of them may touch is deliberately narrow, and the narrowness is the feature:
//   `test`             writes `lastProbe` and NOTHING else — never a credential.
//   `set-credentials`  writes `auth` only, and only after the instance said `ok`.
//   `set-preset` /
//   `set-flags`        write `preset` + `flags` (+ `prodWriteAck`), never a credential.
//   `set-default`      writes `defaultInstance`, and mirrors the LABEL into `.local/config.json`.
//   `remove`           deletes one entry.
// Every one of the last five appends an audit line through ARC-04-S10's writer, so a change made
// from a terminal is as traceable as one made through a tool call.
