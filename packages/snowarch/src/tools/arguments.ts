/**
 * ARC-09-C121 — the arguments a tool declares are the only ones it takes.
 *
 * The server passed `arguments` to the router unchecked and every handler read only the names it knew, so an
 * argument a tool does not declare vanished and the caller believed it had acted: on rc.3,
 * `snow_atf_atf_tests_index { "query": … }` answered the 20 active tests. Measured on the 399 schemas, none was
 * closed, and on eight create tools that set `active: true` themselves one undeclared `active: false` made a
 * live record — the worst a scheduled report that mails its recipients.
 *
 * So the check is ONE place, the router, before any request: an argument the schema does not declare is refused
 * with INVALID_REQUEST, naming it and the declared ones. Every schema is advertised closed
 * (`additionalProperties: false`), so a caller can see the rule as well as meet it. An object argument that
 * declares its own properties is closed and checked one level down; an object that declares none is a map of
 * columns (`fields`, `variables`) and stays open. The items of an array of objects are not checked.
 *
 * A per-call `instance` was ignored silently by ARC-04-S08's choice, because it was never offered. It is refused
 * too, with its own message: a write the caller believes goes to another instance would land on this one, which
 * is worse than a refusal.
