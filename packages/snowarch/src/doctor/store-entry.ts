/**
 * One entry AS THE FILE HOLDS IT — before preset expansion, before flag completion.
 *
 * The loaded runtime is not the same object: `completeFlags` fills every absent flag from the
 * preset, so by the time a check sees `instanceManager`'s entry, all six are there and
 * "which flags did the user actually state?" has no answer. SV-03's FLAGS_INCOMPLETE is a fact
 * about the FILE, and the probe binding needs the credentials the runtime deliberately does not
 * carry, so both read here.
