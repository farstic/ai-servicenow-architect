/**
 * How a store entry becomes something `probeAll` can use — in one place, for three callers.
 *
 * `instance add`, `instance test`/`import --from-legacy` and now the doctor (ARC-08-S04) all probe
 * the same way, and the two rules that matter are easy to lose in a copy: ONE request per probe
 * (`maxRetries: 0` — a 401 retried is an account closer to a lockout on an instance whose policy
 * nobody here knows), and the ROPC seam, where the token is acquired inside the client's first
 * request rather than by a second login attempt of our own.
 *
 * It lives beside the probes rather than in `cli/instance.ts`, where it was, because the doctor
 * must not import the CLI to ask a question about credentials — and because a client factory is
 * not a command.
