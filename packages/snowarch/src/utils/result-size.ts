/**
 * A hard ceiling on what one tool result may put into a client's context.
 *
 * P-27: a `snow_core_records_query` against a large table returned every record the instance
 * gave back, serialised in full. A single call could carry hundreds of thousands of characters
 * into the conversation, and the caller had no way to know it had happened — the result looked
 * exactly like a small one, only longer. Everything here exists to make the opposite true: the
 * output is never over the cap, and when it was cut the result SAYS so, in a field the caller
 * can branch on rather than a sentence it has to read.
 *
 * The two cutting strategies are not interchangeable. A records-shaped result is a LIST, and
 * dropping whole records from the end leaves valid JSON the caller can still parse and use.
 * Everything else is cut as text, which does not, and that is the point of preferring the
 * first: a string cut through a JSON document produces something no caller can do anything
 * with except notice the marker.
