/**
 * The lint's inputs, assembled once — for the CLI and for the doctor.
 *
 * ARC-08-S02's E-18…E-21 run the lint checks themselves rather than a copy of their logic, so the
 * object those checks read had to stop being a literal inside the CLI. It is the same object in
 * both callers; what differs is what happens when an input is missing. The CLI exits 2 ("cannot
 * run" is not "passed"); the doctor turns the same sentence into one FAIL line and keeps reporting
 * the other twenty-two checks, because a diagnostic that stops at the first bad answer hides its
 * own cause.
 *
 * Stdlib only, no git, no spawning: it runs on a fresh clone before `npm ci`.
