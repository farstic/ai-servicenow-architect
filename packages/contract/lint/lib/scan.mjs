/**
 * The scan set: which files the engine lint reads, and — more importantly — which it does not.
 *
 * There is exactly ONE definition of "clean" in this repository, and it lives here. The ARC
 * README's acceptance grep, ARC-02-S12's exit test and the CI job all call the lint rather than
 * writing their own `grep -r`, because two definitions of clean is how a sweep gets declared
 * done against a narrower set than the check enforces (architect's ruling, ARC-05-S03).
 *
 * **History is exempt, and that is a decision, not an oversight.** `docs/plans/**` and
 * `docs/spikes/**` cite old tool names and old MCP prefixes *as evidence* — the S-14
 * plugin-channel spike records carry `mcp__plugin_…__` prefixes because that is what was
 * measured, and rewriting them would destroy the record. `docs/CHANGELOG.md` names what things
 * used to be called, which is its job. What stays in scope is everything a reader might act on
 * today, plus `docs/decisions/**` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, which may name a retired thing
 * only on a line carrying the historical marker.
