/**
 * L08 — the engine's pin and the server's contract disagree about a tool.
 *
 * The engine-side mirror of the server suite's test 2. Both are needed and neither is redundant:
 * the server test fails in the package that changed the tool, at the moment it changes; this fails
 * in a clone with no `node_modules`, in the lint everyone runs, without installing the workspace.
 *
 * All four fields are compared, not just `gate` and `mutates`. `sessionMutates` decides whether a
 * tool reaches the `ask` list, and `alsoRequires` is the second gate six tools enforce after the
 * first — a pin that lost either would still look right in a diff of names.
