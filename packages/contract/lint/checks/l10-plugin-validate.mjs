/**
 * L10 — `claude plugin validate` on the skills and agents directories.
 *
 * The only check here that needs a tool outside this repository, which shapes how it behaves. In
 * the `lint` job the CLI is not installed, so L10 says it skipped and why; enforcement lives in the
 * dedicated `plugin validate` job, where the CLI is. A check that silently passed when it could not
 * run would make that job look redundant, and it would be the one actually doing the work.
 *
 * `--require-claude` turns absence into "cannot run" (exit 2), which is what the enforcing job
 * passes: there, a missing CLI means the job is misconfigured, not that there is nothing to check.
