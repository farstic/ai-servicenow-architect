/**
 * L06 — a generated file that is not what its generator would produce.
 *
 * The failure this catches is specific and has happened: a maintainer accepts a contract change
 * with `pin.mjs`, the sha moves, and every generated file's header — and the tables rendered from
 * the contract — are now stale. Nothing else notices, because each generated file is still valid
 * markdown and the tests that read the contract read the contract, not the documents about it.
 *
 * Every generator's own `--check` is the judge, from the one list in `scripts/lib/generators.mjs`.
 * Re-deriving "is it current" here would be a second opinion, and the one that is wrong when they
 * disagree is always the copy.
