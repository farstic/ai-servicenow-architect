/**
 * L02 — every `mcp__<key>__` prefix equals the one the registration actually uses.
 *
 * The value comes from `engine.config.json` and from nowhere else. That is the point of the
 * check: P-05 was three different registration prefixes live in the tree at once, with no
 * single place saying which was right. Hard-coding the expected prefix here would recreate the
 * problem one level up — there would again be two declarations, and the lint would enforce its
 * own rather than the product's. (The three are listed in `retired-names.json`, which is where
 * a reader should look: naming them here would put them in a file the ratchet scans.)
