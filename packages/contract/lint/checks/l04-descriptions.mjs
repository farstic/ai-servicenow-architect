/**
 * L04 — a skill or agent description that is too long, or shaped so it will not register.
 *
 * Both failures are silent at runtime. A description over 500 characters is truncated by the
 * harness, and a `": "` inside an unquoted YAML scalar makes the frontmatter parse as a map, which
 * drops the agent from the registry with no error anywhere (`.claude/agents/now-assist-specialist.md`
 * lost a whole persona to that once).
 *
 * The rules come from `tests/lib/lint-rules.mjs` — ARC-02-S02's SK-02 and AG-02 — rather than a
 * second implementation. Two implementations of "too long" is two answers to the same question.
