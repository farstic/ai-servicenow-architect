/**
 * The engine lint: does any governing text cite something the server does not have?
 *
 * Five checks today (S04 adds the rest):
 *
 *   L01  every `snow_*` token is a tool in the contract
 *   L02  every `mcp__…__` prefix is the one `engine.config.json` declares
 *   L03  no retired name outside the three files where naming the past is the job
 *   L07  the registration key agrees across its four declarations
 *   L11  the pin's sha still describes the committed contract
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node packages/contract/lint/engine-lint.mjs [--json] [--root <dir>] [--only L01,L03]
 *
 * Exit 0 pass · 1 findings · 2 cannot run. "Cannot run" is separate from "found problems" on
 * purpose: a missing `dist/contract.json` means the check never happened, and a caller that
 * treated that as a pass would be reassured by silence.
 *
 * Stdlib only, no shelling out, no git. It has to work on a fresh clone before `npm ci`, and it
 * has to finish in a couple of seconds on every CI cell — including Windows, where spawning a
 * process per file would dominate the runtime.
