 * six months later is a tarball and a tag, and everything a verifier needs about what was released
 * has to be readable from it. So the message carries the contract sha, the docs pin and the three
 * floors, and `./snowarch version` (S04), `release.yml` (S03) and `./snowarch upgrade` (S07) all
 * read them back through `parseTagMessage` rather than each writing its own parser against a shape
 * they would eventually disagree about.
 *
 * The two functions are a round trip, asserted as one in `tests/release.test.mjs`: a builder whose
 * output its own parser cannot read is the failure mode that would only surface in S07, on a user's
 * machine, during an upgrade.
