// ARC-08-S08 — the SessionStart banner: one truthful `Mode:` line, and at most four nudges.
// ARC-11-C1 — and, second, the `Licence:` line, from `.local/licence.json` and the cached revocation list.
//
// THREE PROMISES, and they are the reason this file is shaped the way it is.
//
//   IT NEVER FAILS A SESSION. Every path exits 0, nothing reaches stderr, and any exception at all
//   becomes one honest line. A hook that exits non-zero or writes to stderr is a session that
//   starts with an error message about the tool that was supposed to help.
//
//   IT IS FAST. The fast path reads two small JSON files and prints — two more for the licence line,
//   with one small module and one signature check — and it imports no part of the
//   doctor, because importing the check registry to decide whether it needs the check registry
//   would spend the whole budget before the decision. The doctor arrives through a lazy `import()`
//   on the re-run branch only.
//
//   IT NEVER GUESSES. The line it prints was DERIVED by the doctor from the toggle file and the
//   store (ARC-08-S05) and cached; when the cache no longer describes this checkout it re-runs the
//   offline subset rather than printing something older than the facts.
//
// The root comes from this file's own location, never from `cwd` and never from
// `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`: inside a session that variable is the SESSION's project, which is the same
// directory here and is not guaranteed to be, and a banner that described another checkout would
// be worse than no banner.
