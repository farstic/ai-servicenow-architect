/**
 * Where `.local/` lives — the repository root, unless `SNOWARCH_STATE_ROOT` redirects it.
 *
 * ARC-07-C43, HEAD 1 OF TWO, AND IT IS INERT ON ITS OWN. `root` above is derived from THIS FILE's
 * location, which is right for reading the corpus and the contract and is exactly why a spawned CLI
 * cannot be pointed away from the checkout's state: a child given a temp `cwd` still discovers the
 * same root and still writes `.local/logs/<command>-<stamp>.log`, `.local/doctor-last.json` and
 * `.local/upgrade-check.json` into the repository. Five suites do that on every `npm test` — the
 * measured list is in C43's row — and `.local/` is gitignored, so `assert-clean` cannot see it.
 *
 * NOTHING SETS THE VARIABLE YET, and that is deliberate rather than unfinished. Head 2 routes the
 * twenty sites that still hand-build `.local/…` instead of calling the builders below, and only then
 * does the harness set it. Until then this returns the root it was given, so the half-moved state a
 * partial redirect would produce — a doctor reading the real `bootstrap-state.json` while writing its
 * cache somewhere else — cannot happen: it needs a value, and there is nobody to supply one. For the
 * same reason the variable is NOT documented, defaulted or advertised anywhere until head 2 lands;
 * the first reader who exported it early would get precisely that doctor.
 *
 * IT REDIRECTS ONLY THIS CHECKOUT'S STATE. A caller that passes a fixture root of its own keeps it,
 * so a test that deliberately writes into a temp tree cannot be captured by an exported variable, and
 * one that means to redirect the real root has to say so. Reads and writes both go through it, so a
 * redirected state root is coherent rather than half-moved.
 *
 * `env` is a parameter for the reason `loadState`'s `read` is: so a case can set it without touching
 * the process it runs in.
