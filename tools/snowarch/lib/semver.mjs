/**
 * One version comparator, for every place this product decides which release is newer.
 *
 * ARC-09-S12. `rehearse.sh 2.0.0-rc.10` refused to cut the release:
 *
 *   release: 2.0.0-rc.10 is not greater than the latest tag v2.0.0-rc.9
 *
 * The prerelease part was compared as a string, and `"rc.10" < "rc.9"` because `1` sorts before
 * `9`. Two copies had it — `compareVersions` in `scripts/lib/release/preflight.mjs` and `sortTags`
 * in `tools/snowarch/lib/commands/upgrade.mjs` — written independently, wrong identically, which is
 * what a rule stated twice does. The release check was the loud one; the quiet one was worse:
 * `sortTags` is what `./snowarch upgrade --pre` uses to pick the target, so a checkout on rc.9
 * would have been told rc.9 was the newest and never offered rc.10, and `E-28` would have agreed
 * with it because it reads the same order.
 *
 * So the rule lives here once, and both call sites import it. It is the rule from the
 * specification, not an approximation that happens to sort our tags:
 *
 *   §11.2  major, minor and patch compare numerically.
 *   §11.3  a version WITH a prerelease is lower than the same triple without one.
 *   §11.4  prerelease identifiers compare field by field —
 *            numeric fields numerically,
 *            alphanumeric fields lexically in ASCII order,
 *            a numeric field is ALWAYS lower than an alphanumeric one,
 *            and when every preceding field is equal, more fields beats fewer.
 *
 * Build metadata (`+…`) is deliberately absent: §10 says it is ignored for precedence, and this
 * product has never tagged one. A parser that silently accepted and ranked it would be inventing an
 * order the specification says does not exist.
