// have to print the same sentences with no Node to read them: bash and PowerShell can each parse a
// small JSON file, and their parity test reads this one. ARC-08's doctor reuses the same table, so
// a remedy improved here improves everywhere it is quoted.
//
// A remedy is never a paragraph. It is the one command or the one sentence that ends the problem —
// anything longer is a document, and a document in an error message is a document nobody reads.
