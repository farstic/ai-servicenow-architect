// ARC-06-S07 — npm's log → the sentence the operator needs.
//
// `npm ci` fails in a handful of ways that all look the same from outside ("it didn't install"),
// and four of them have completely different fixes. The mapping is a module rather than a switch
// inside B04 because ARC-08's doctor reports the same failures and must say the same words.
//
// The network cases lean on ARC-03-S05's shared vocabulary where the SUBJECT is the same, and
// diverge where it is not: npm reaches the registry, not github.com, and its CA setting is its own.
