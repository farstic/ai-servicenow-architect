/**
 * The git questions this product asks, in one place, with one rule about failure.
 *
 * ARC-09-S04. Four callers wanted "which tag, which commit, is it dirty" and each would have
 * reached for `execFileSync('git', …)` with its own idea of what a non-zero exit means. S01 already
 * learned what that costs: its helper returned `''` for a failed command, so a `git status
 * --porcelain` that could not run read as a CLEAN TREE and a release proceeded on a repository git
 * itself could not describe. **A refusal to answer and an answer of "nothing" are different
 * values.** Here a failed command throws, and every caller that can live without an answer asks
 * for `{ allowFail: true }` and gets `null`.
 *
 * No shell, ever: on Windows `git` is `git.exe` and a shell would bring quoting rules with it. The
 * timeout is five seconds — long enough for a cold index on a slow disk, short enough that
 * `version` never hangs a terminal.
