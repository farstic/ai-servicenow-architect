// ARC-06-S05 — is this checkout inside a folder something synchronises, and whose?
//
// WHETHER is already answered, by `isUnderCloudSyncFolder` in the committed server build. This
// module imports it rather than re-deriving it: a second segment table would drift, and the two
// would disagree about a path exactly when it mattered. What it adds is WHICH — the warning has to
// name the provider, because "a cloud-synced folder" tells someone nothing they can act on.
//
// The import reaches into `packages/snowarch/dist/`, which is IN-REPO committed JavaScript, not an
// npm dependency: the bootstrap still installs nothing, `dist-check` keeps the build current, and
// `paths.js` imports `node:` modules only — which matters, because B01 runs in a design-only
// checkout that has never seen `npm ci`.

 *
 * THE ENVIRONMENT ROOTS COME FIRST (ARC-08-C2), for the reason above and because the server's
 * `detectCloudSync` has checked them from the start — this function had not, so the module's two
 * halves disagreed with each other on exactly that case: with `%OneDrive%` set to a redirected
 * Documents folder, `isUnderCloudSyncFolder()` (which delegates to the server's detector, and so
 * reads the ambient environment) answered TRUE while this answered null, and `cloudSyncWarning()`
 * therefore printed nothing. Measured before the fix. That is the disagreement this module's own
 * header says it imports the server's function to prevent, and the fixture's `env[]` rows were
 * read by nobody, so nothing caught it.
 *
 * NAMED VENDORS NEXT, across the whole path. `~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Corp/…` is both a
 * CloudStorage mount and a OneDrive one, and this used to answer with the mount — because
 * `CloudStorage` sat above `OneDrive` in the table and `Library` comes first in the path. Saying
 * "a cloud provider" about a folder whose name says OneDrive is this function refusing to read.
 * The server's detector had the same ordering bug, found by the same fixture row.
 *
 * `env` defaults to `process.env`, which is what the server does, so every existing caller gains
 * the case without being changed. It is a PARAMETER so a test can inject one — a rule that can only
 * be exercised by mutating the real environment is a rule nobody tests twice.
 *
 * NO `realpath`. The server resolves both sides through an injected one; this stays pure stdlib,
 * because B01 runs it in a checkout that has never seen `npm ci` and a function that touches the
 * filesystem is one more thing that can fail there. The fixture's rows need no resolution.
