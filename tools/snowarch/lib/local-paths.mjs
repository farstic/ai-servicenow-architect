/**
 * ARC-07-C43 head 2 — every path under `.local/`, in one place.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Head 1 put `SNOWARCH_STATE_ROOT` beside the root discovery and taught the six
 * path builders to ask for it. It could not be turned on, because twenty-five OTHER sites built
 * `join(root, '.local', …)` by hand — the doctor four times, `steps/B06` five, `commands/upgrade`
 * twice, and so on. A redirect honoured by six builders and ignored by twenty-five is a state root
 * that is half-moved: a redirected doctor would read the real `bootstrap-state.json` while writing its
 * cache into the temp directory, which is the "create one place, write to another" defect one level
 * up. The twenty-five were not a rule anyone broke; they were the absence of a place to put the rule.
 *
 * SO THE RULE HAS A HOME, and this is it. Everything under `.local/` is named here, once, and the
 * modules that used to own a path re-export it so no importer had to move.
 *
 * IT IS A LEAF, DELIBERATELY. It imports `node:path` and `config.mjs` and nothing else, because the
 * alternative was a cycle: `bootstrap.mjs` and `steps/` need the store path, `mode.mjs` used to own
 * it, and `mode.mjs` imports `bootstrap.mjs`. Anything that reads or writes state can import this
 * safely, whatever else it imports.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE. A path built against a root that is NOT this checkout — `commands/upgrade.mjs`
 * links the checkout's `.local/` into the worktree it just made, and that worktree's own `.local`
 * entry is a location in another tree rather than this checkout's state. Redirecting it would put the
 * link somewhere the upgrade is not looking. The rule is about THIS checkout's state directory, and a
 * caller that means another tree says so with `join(thatRoot, '.local')` and a comment.

 * (`checks/engine-repo.mjs` passes `.local`), so the path arrives as data rather than as a call. It
 * still has to follow the state root, and a path that is not under `.local/` still has to not —
 * a fix that chmodded a redirected directory when it meant a file in the checkout would be repairing
 * something nobody reported.
