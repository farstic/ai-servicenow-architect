// personal overrides, whatever Claude Code has written there on their behalf — and the bootstrap's
// business with it is exactly two array members and one hook entry. So this reads, computes a
// target, and writes back the SAME OBJECT with those changes applied: other keys untouched, other
// array members preserved, existing key order kept, new keys appended.
//
// Exported because ARC-08's `--fix` and ARC-06-S12's `mode` both need to write the same file the
// same way. A second writer would be a second opinion about what "the toggles" are.
