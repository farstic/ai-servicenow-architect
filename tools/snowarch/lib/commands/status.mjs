/**
 * ARC-08-C18 — `./snowarch status`: the panel, as a command.
 *
 * It exists so that a terminal user and a Claude session read the SAME lines. SKILL.md § status
 * used to be a renderer in prose — seven lines with their JSON keys in brackets, a null rule, a
 * failure branch, an exit-3 branch and three named causes for "the doctor cannot run" — executed by
 * a language model once per session. Everything it described is now code: `renderPanel` for the
 * seven lines, `resolveCheckout` for the exit-3 branch, and `fallbackPanel` below for the causes,
 * each named only when this command actually observed it.
 *
 * IN-PROCESS, not a spawn of `./snowarch doctor --quick --json`. The SessionStart banner runs on a
 * budget ARC-09-C8 measured in single milliseconds on Windows, and a spawn spends a whole Node
 * start-up before the first check runs.
 *
 * `--json` emits the doctor report UNCHANGED — byte-for-byte what `doctor --quick --json` prints,
 * masked at the same boundary. A panel-shaped JSON would be a second schema for one set of facts,
 * and the first consumer to read the wrong one would be reading a shape nothing maintains.

 * The mode is READ from `.local/bootstrap-state.json` rather than derived, and the sentence says
 * so — "from bootstrap state" is the difference between a fact established a moment ago and one
 * the bootstrap recorded at install time, and a reader deciding whether to trust it needs to know
 * which they have.
 *
 * THE CAUSE IS PASSED IN, never assumed. SKILL.md's rule was *"never state a cause you did not
 * check"* and then `BANNER.fromState` stated one unconditionally: *"until Node 20+ is installed"*,
 * which is the one cause this command can never be the one to report — a machine without Node
 * cannot run it to find out. Every caller below names what it actually observed.
 *
 * When the state file is missing or unreadable the panel says THAT, rather than a mode it does not
 * have. A remedy for the wrong problem costs the reader the time they spend following it.
