 * `.local/upgrade-check.json` — what the banner reads, and what nobody else may make it do.
 *
 * ARC-09-S07. The banner's contract is the point of this file: the SessionStart hook must be able
 * to say "a newer release exists" in under 300 ms on a machine that may have no Node, which means
 * it cannot fetch, cannot ask git, and cannot wait. So it reads ONE file that somebody else wrote
 * — `upgrade`, `upgrade --check`, or E-28 — and the writing is always a thing the user started.
 *
 * Three keys are the hook's contract and may never be renamed: `behind`, `latestTag`, `checkedAt`
 * (ARC-08-S08). The rest is this story's superset, for a reader who runs `cat` on it and for
 * `--check`'s own output. A file is not a promise that a fetch ever succeeded: `behind: false`
 * with a `checkedAt` from last month is the honest answer "nothing has been checked lately", and
 * the FRESHNESS rule below is what turns it into silence rather than into a stale nudge.
