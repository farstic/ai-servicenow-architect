/**
 * ARC-06-C10 — what each number MEANS, in words, beside the numbers.
 *
 * The overlap this file already names — `3` is "corpus missing" in the docs family and "prerequisite
 * missing" here — was called tolerable, and an occurrence proved it is not. A CI log carrying
 * `##[error]Process completed with exit code 3` and nothing else was read by someone with this file
 * open, and mapped to the wrong family (#193, ARC-09-C40).
 *
 * Renumbering was the alternative and was rejected on evidence: the table is published in
 * `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `snowarch.cmd` prints its Node sentence with a hard-coded 3, and B02 keys
 * remedies off the docs family's numbers. So the numbers stay and the RUN says which family it
 * belongs to, on its last line — the number is never the only signal.
