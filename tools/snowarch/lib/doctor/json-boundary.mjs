// ARC-08-C1 — what the `--json` form may carry, and what it may not.
//
// `--json` IS THE FORM THAT TRAVELS. The text report, the banner and the doctor cache are local to
// one machine and keep the user's own words; the JSON is what an issue template asks a stranger to
// paste into a public tracker, and a validation record's lint would refuse the same content
// (ARC-10-S07). So this masks at the boundary rather than at each site that writes a string.
//
// MEASURED, on a live fixture at ARC-10-S10: the label appeared in SEVEN fields across four shapes
// — `modeLine`, `modeLineDetailed`, `server.instances[].label`, two check `detail` strings and two
// `data.fix*.label` payloads. That is the argument for masking BY VALUE rather than by field: the
// eighth field arrives without anyone remembering the ruling that created this file.
//
// THE STANDARD THIS BOUNDARY IS HELD TO is ARC-10-S07's own six redaction patterns — the ones a
// validation record is refused for. Labels and hosts were the two the ruling named; the home path
// is the third, and it was found by the test asserting the general property rather than by anyone
// re-reading this file (ARC-08-C1, second pass). If a seventh field shape arrives, the S07 scan in the test is
// what will say so.
//
// The host was NOT in that JSON. It is masked anyway, with the same shape the cache guard uses
// (ARC-09-C9's `INSTANCE_HOST`, imported rather than rewritten): the guard exists because
// `redact()` leaves an instance address alone, and a report that only happens not to carry one is
// not the same as a report that cannot.

 * A home directory, in every shape the platforms write one — `/Users/<name>`, `/home/<name>`,
 * `C:\Users\<name>` and the forward-slash form Node hands back on Windows.
 *
 * ARC-08-C1, second pass. The label and the host were masked here from the start; the checkout PATH was not, and
 * it carries the user's account name on every platform. Measured on a real (non-fixture) report:
 * three fields — `checks[].detail`, `checks[].data.root`, `checks[].data.toplevel` — each reading
 * `/Users/<me>/work/ai-servicenow-architect`.
 *
 * Only the home prefix goes. What follows it is the part a maintainer reading a pasted report
 * actually uses — how deep the checkout is, whether the path has a space in it, which drive it is
 * on. That is the part a maintainer reading a pasted report uses, and none of it names
 * anybody. `~` rather than a bracketed token because the result is still a path and reads
 * as one — `~/work/repo`.

/**
 * The home the ENTRY POINT was given, masked BY VALUE — the same argument as the label.
 *
 * The four shapes above are the common ones, not the only ones: a home can be `/opt/people/ana`, a
 * mounted volume, or whatever an administrator chose, and none of those match a pattern. The
 * machine's own answer covers the case no pattern can.
 *
 * IT ARRIVES AS AN ARGUMENT, and that is a rule rather than a preference: nothing under `lib/` reads
 * the home directory itself — not `homedir()`, not `process.env.HOME`, not `USERPROFILE`.
 * `tools/snowarch/tests/mode-register.test.mjs` fails the build on any of them. `bin/snowarch.mjs`
 * calls `homedir()` once and threads the answer through, which is also what lets a test point a
 * whole run at a fixture without touching the environment. The first version of this file read the
 * environment directly and that guard caught it, correctly.
 *
 * (This paragraph is allowed to SPELL what the rule forbids only because of ARC-06-C1: the guard
 * used to scan raw text and fired on the prose explaining it. Naming them here is the point — a
 * reader who does not know which two variables are meant cannot obey the rule.)
 *
 * The guard on the VALUE is not decoration either. A home of `/`, a bare drive root or an empty
 * string would match inside every absolute path in the report and turn it to nonsense; below four
 * characters there is nothing worth masking and plenty to break, so such a value is ignored and the
 * shapes above still apply.
