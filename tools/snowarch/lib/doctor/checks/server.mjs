// ARC-08-S04 — SV-00…SV-08: the server package's own checks, run inside the engine's report.

// THE ENGINE DOES NOT RE-IMPLEMENT ANY OF THEM. Flag rules, store schema, presets and the stdio
// handshake are the server's subject, and a second implementation in engine JavaScript is `00`
// P-16 exactly: two answers to one question, and the one users see is the one that is wrong. So
// this file imports `runServerDoctor`, hands it the options it needs, and adopts its results into
// the registry shape.
//
// The import is BY FILE PATH, never the bare specifier the package's `exports` map publishes:
// `tools/snowarch` has no `node_modules` of its own, and the workspace symlink in the root's only
// exists after `npm ci` — which a design-only checkout never runs. The specifier stays the public
// API for other consumers, and a test asserts both resolve to the same module when it can.
