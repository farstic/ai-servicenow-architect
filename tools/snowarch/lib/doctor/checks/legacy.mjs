// `--fix`, not ever — and `tests/doctor/legacy.test.mjs` greps it for the mutating verbs rather
// than trusting the sentence. The grep is the story's literal one, so this comment states the rule
// without spelling those verbs: a file whose prose names them fails its own check.
// `readFileSync`, `existsSync`, `statSync`, `readdirSync`: the whole filesystem vocabulary here.
//
// Why it matters more here than anywhere else in the doctor: `00` P-34 counted SIX copies of one
// credential across the old layout, and the `.bak-*` files Claude Code writes keep every secret the
// original had. A user who deletes the registration and stops there still has the password on disk.
