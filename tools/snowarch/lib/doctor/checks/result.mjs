// ARC-08-S02 — the three sentences a check can end with, written once.
//
// A check returns data, never text a reader sees directly: the runner redacts it, the text report
// pads it into a column and the JSON report keys it. These helpers exist so that twenty-three
// checks cannot each invent a slightly different shape for "this is fine" — and so `data` is
// always present, which S09 renders without re-deriving anything.
