// `tests/never-commit.test.mjs` sweeps the tracked tree at commit time; the doctor's E-09 sweeps
// the same tree on the user's machine, where the file that leaked may never have reached a commit
// this repository sees. Two hunts, one description of the quarry — because a doctor that used a
// looser pattern than CI would clear a checkout CI would reject, and a stricter one would fail a
// checkout that is fine.
//
// The regexes deliberately keep their original spelling. `JSONISH` cannot match its own source
// (after the opening quote comes `(`, not a key), which is what lets the file that defines the
// sweep survive the sweep — the mistake made thirteen times before it was written down.
