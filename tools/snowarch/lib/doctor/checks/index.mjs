// the order WITHIN a section: prerequisites before the repository they are needed for, the corpus
// before the citations that read it, the roster before the contract the roster's text must agree
// with. A reader who works down the report is following the dependency chain.
//
// S03 added the `legacy` and `host` detectors (E-23…E-27) and S04 the `SV-` checks — the server
// package's own, adopted rather than re-implemented. All of them append to this list rather than
// building a registry of their own, because `--section` and `--quick` are answers about ONE
// registry.
