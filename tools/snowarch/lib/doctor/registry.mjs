// ARC-08-S01 — the check registry: what a check IS, and where the list of them lives.
//
// The doctor is a runner over a registry, not a script of steps. That distinction is the whole
// design: a step is a thing the bootstrap DOES, in order, and failing one stops the install; a
// check is a question about the checkout that must be answered even when the previous answer was
// bad. So every check runs, every check is timed, and one that throws becomes a `fail` with the
// message rather than an aborted run — an operator reading a half-finished report cannot tell
// which half is missing.
//
// This story ships the registry EMPTY. S02–S04 add the checks; the harness below is what lets a
// test register one, which is how the framework is proved before any real check exists.
