// ARC-08-S05 — the authoritative `Mode:` line: derived, never remembered.
//
// The rule file's promise is that this line is the mode — "never infer mode from any other file"
// — and a promise like that is only as good as the number of places that can produce it. So the
// derivation is a PURE FUNCTION of four facts, the sentences live in `text.mjs` with every other
// Mode line the product prints, and this module renders through `modeLine()` rather than holding
// a second sentence table.
//
// What it never reads is `~/.claude.json`. That file is where the OLD engine looked for the mode
// (`00` P-05/P-21), and it is wrong three ways: it belongs to Claude Code, it describes the
// registration rather than the configuration, and a stale entry there outlived the install it
// described. The toggle file and the store are the two things that decide, and both are ours.
