// ARC-08-S01 — the redaction pass the RUNNER applies to every string a check produces.
//
// The rule is not "checks should be careful". It is that a check has no path to the output that
// skips this: the runner redacts `detail`, `remedy`, `command` and every string leaf of `data`
// before anything is rendered, so a check written in six months by someone who has not read this
// file cannot leak a value it did not know was sensitive.
//
// ONE REDACTOR. The bootstrap's `lib/redact.mjs` already answers "does this text contain something
// that must not be printed" — secret-shaped keys, Authorization headers, usernames, registered
// values. This module IMPORTS it and adds what a doctor report needs on top: home directories
// become `~`, proxy URLs lose their credentials, and the whole thing walks an object. Two
// redactors would be two opinions about what a secret is, and the one users see would be whichever
// was written second.
