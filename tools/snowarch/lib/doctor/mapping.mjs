// ARC-08-S07 — every check the old engine's `doctor.sh` made, and where it went.
//
// `00` §3.9 calls that script the most precise existing specification of a correct install, and it
// is: 39 numbered checks written against a real machine over two years. Rewriting the doctor
// without accounting for each one would have lost intent that nobody would notice missing until a
// user's install broke in a way the old script would have caught.
//
// So this is DATA, and three things read it: the appendix table in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (rendered
// by `scripts/gen-doctor-docs.mjs`), the "new checks with no old counterpart" list (computed as the
// registry minus this table, never typed), and `tests/doctor/mapping.test.mjs`, which asserts every
// `D` id occurs exactly once, that every new id named here exists in the registry, and that the old
// script really contains the ids this table claims to account for.
//
// A row is `retired` only with the ARC or story that made it unnecessary. "We decided not to" is
// not a reason anybody can audit a year later.
