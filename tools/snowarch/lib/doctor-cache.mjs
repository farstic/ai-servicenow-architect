// put a URL is a `detail` string.

 * configured and has no reason to quote prose. It is wrong for a doctor report, which
 * legitimately quotes documentation: E-00's remedy names the Claude Code install page, and a
 * missing corpus names the repo to clone. The consequence was not a redacted field, it was NO
 * CACHE AT ALL — the throw abandoned the whole write — so on any machine without Claude Code on
 * PATH every session paid the banner's re-run path and `/snowarch status` read nothing, silently.
 * Older than C8; C8 only exposed it, because the fixtures used to run `--quick`, which omits E-00.
 *
 * What the cache refuses:
 *   - a KEY that names a secret — exactly as the state file does;
 *   - a VALUE the redactor would rewrite — credentials, `KEY=value` text, addresses;
 *   - a VALUE carrying an INSTANCE URL. This clause is not redundant: `register()` is called only
 *     from `instance-file.mjs` and only for `password`/`clientSecret`, so an instance host is NOT
 *     registered and `redact()` returns it unchanged — measured, not assumed. Without this clause
 *     the cache would store `https://dev12345.service-now.com` verbatim.
 * Documentation URLs pass, and are stored verbatim; that is the point of the change.
