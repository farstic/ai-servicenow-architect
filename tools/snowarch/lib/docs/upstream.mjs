//
// A SEPARATE MODULE from `sync.mjs`, deliberately. `sync` is the user-safe local reconcile that
// bootstrap, the doctor and every developer run; this is a maintainer operation that mutates the
// repository's own configuration and stages a change for review. They share plumbing but not
// audience, not blast radius and not a report format — and `sync.mjs` was already the longest file
// in this directory. The import direction is one-way: upstream depends on sync, never the reverse.
//
// It never commits. The pin moves, the gitlink moves, both are staged, and a human reads the diff
// of dead citations before deciding. S09's workflow pastes the report below verbatim as a PR body
// and keys on exit 1, so the headings are a contract.
