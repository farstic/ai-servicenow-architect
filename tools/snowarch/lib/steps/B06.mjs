// bootstrap is also using. The NON-INTERACTIVE path never has a terminal at all: it reads a 0600
// file, probes once, and writes the store.
//
// Everything that needs `node_modules` is imported LAZILY. `dist/cli/index.js` and the store's
// schema module both exist only after B04, and a design-only run — which never reaches this step —
// must still be able to load the module. A test asserts that nothing here is imported at load time.
