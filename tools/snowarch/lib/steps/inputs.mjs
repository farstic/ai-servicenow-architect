// ARC-06-S03 — what a step's inputs are, and how they become one hash.
//
// A step declares `inputs(ctx) → string[]`, and every entry is TAGGED: `file:<path relative to the
// root>` or `text:<value>`. The tag is not ceremony. Untagged, the runner has to guess whether
// `design-only` is a path or a value, and the guess it would make — "treat anything that is not on
// disk as a missing file" — hashes a literal as `<absent>` and makes two different modes produce
// the same hash. An untagged entry is therefore an error at hash time, so a step that gets this
// wrong cannot be written and then quietly cached forever.
