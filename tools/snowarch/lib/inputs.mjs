/**
 * What each bootstrap step depends on, in one table — and therefore what makes it stale.
 *
 * ARC-09-S05. The resume rule is simple and load-bearing: a step whose inputs have not changed
 * since it last succeeded is skipped. Everything hard about it is the word "inputs", and until now
 * each step answered that question in its own file, which meant ten answers, ten places to get one
 * wrong, and no way to show a user the set.
 *
 * One table now. A row says which committed inputs a step reads, in which order, and WHY — the
 * why is the part a reader needs, because the interesting decisions here are the things
 * deliberately NOT hashed:
 *
 *   **The corpus is hashed by its GITLINK, not its contents.** 35,000 files read to decide whether
 *   to skip a step, and an unrelated `touch` would invalidate it. The gitlink changes exactly when
 *   the corpus is meant to be different.
 *
 *   **The store is hashed by mtime and size, never by content.** Credentials are never hashed,
 *   read or rewritten by any step other than the wizard and the migration. AC 2 is the proof: edit
 *   a password in place, same length, restore the mtime, and every step stays fresh — because
 *   nothing looked.
 *
 *   **`dist/` is hashed as bytes**, because a contract that changed is a server that behaves
 *   differently, and that is exactly when B05 and B08 must run again.
 *
 * Determinism across platforms is the other requirement, and it is why files are hashed as BYTES
 * with no line-ending normalisation: `.gitattributes` keeps every hashed file LF in every checkout,
 * and a test asserts that the hashed set is covered by it. A file that arrived CRLF on Windows
 * would hash differently there, and AC 4 — the same commit hashing the same on three OSes — would
 * be false in a way nobody would notice until a resume misbehaved on one platform.
