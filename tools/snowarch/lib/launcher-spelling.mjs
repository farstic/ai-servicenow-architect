// ARC-07-C31 — the engine's launcher spelling, and the ONLY engine file allowed to spell it.
//
// These four strings lived in `text.mjs`, which `tests/windows-spellings.test.mjs` exempted as a
// DEFINITION. The exemption's comment named the definition; the exemption's BEHAVIOUR skipped the
// whole file — so the 500 lines of sentences around it were the one place in the engine where a
// hand-spelled `./snowarch` could be written, read back green, and shipped. Slice 1 of C31 fixed six
// such messages and the guard did not notice either the breakage or the repair: two controls run
// against it — appending a fresh literal, and reverting `BANNER.upgrade` to its hand-spelled form —
// both left it 9/9 green.
//
// So the definition moved HERE, to a file that is nothing but the definition. `text.mjs` is now read
// like every other file, and the exemption covers four lines that a reader can hold in one glance.
//
// A LEAF, with no imports, and that is load-bearing beyond tidiness. `text.mjs` sits inside the
// `panel -> text -> report-text -> panel` cycle, where a module-level `spellings()` threw
// `Cannot access 'isWindowsShell' before initialization` — the same cycle cost this programme a day.
// Nothing imports this file's dependencies because it has none, so `spellings` is initialised before
// any cycle can be entered, and a module-load call on it is safe from anywhere.
//
// WHAT MAY BE ADDED HERE: nothing. A sentence that needs the spelling takes it as an argument.
