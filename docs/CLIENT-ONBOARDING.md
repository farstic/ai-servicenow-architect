# Client onboarding

The ritual for taking on a new engagement. It exists because the confidentiality firewall is enforced by
folder discipline, not by the tool: everything for one client lives under `clients/<name>/`, and
`clients/` is gitignored, so nothing an engagement produces can reach the repository by accident.

Time: about 30 minutes, plus a first real task.

## 1 — Gather context

**Required.** Client short name (lowercase, hyphenated — it becomes the folder name). The ServiceNow
products in scope. The release family the client is on, if it differs from the vendored default. The
delivery model (waterfall, agile, hybrid) and who signs off.

**Strongly recommended.** Instance topology (which sub-production instances exist and what each is for).
Existing customisation posture — how much custom already exists, and whether the client knows it. The
named stakeholders and their roles. Any regulatory or data-residency constraint.

**Optional, added as discovered.** Naming conventions the client already uses. Their update-set and
release cadence. Known pain points that will shape which specialists you reach for.

## 2 — Create the working folder structure

```bash
mkdir -p clients/<name>/scripts/{script-includes,business-rules,client-scripts,scheduled-jobs}
mkdir -p clients/<name>/scripts/atf
mkdir -p clients/<name>/flows
mkdir -p clients/<name>/designs
mkdir -p clients/<name>/stories
mkdir -p clients/<name>/runbooks
mkdir -p clients/<name>/decisions
```

`clients/` is gitignored — these folders are local to your checkout. No `git add` is needed, or
possible. Keeping generated artefacts physically separated by client *is* the confidentiality
discipline: there is no interface-level firewall, so if you work in the wrong folder, nothing stops you.

`decisions/` is where architecture decision records go — every §1.1 ruling, approval or rejection alike,
per the delivery-governance rules. The traceability matrix lives alongside them at
`clients/<name>/traceability.md`, and the RAID log at `clients/<name>/raid-log.md`.

## 3 — Write the engagement-state file

Create `clients/<name>/<name>-engagement-state.md` holding what you gathered in step 1, plus the
engagement defaults the architect should apply silently: release family, delivery model, naming
conventions, sign-off path. The Chief Architect reads this at Phase 1 Step 2 of every request, which is
how a request stops needing the same preamble every time. It is the one engagement file there is: the
builders that read a role matrix (Story Writer, Technical Designer, HLD/LLD Writer, Now Assist
Specialist) read the same file, so keep a **Roles** section in it — each role the client names, and the
ServiceNow role it maps to.

An unresolved question about the engagement itself goes in the same file under **Open questions**, numbered
`OQ-ES-1`, `OQ-ES-2`… (`governance/governance-rules.md` §4.4): a story and a design number their own
questions from 1 as well, and the kind in the id is what stops the three being confused in one answer.

## 4 — Connect the instance, if the engagement is live

```
/snowarch setup-instance
```

or `./snowarch instance add <label> …` (ARC-07). Credentials are stored per instance, outside the
repository. An engagement can stay design-only indefinitely — connecting is a choice, not a step.

## 5 — Smoke test

Ask for something small and domain-specific: a story for a requirement the client actually has, or a
question about a baseline process in one of their products. What you are checking is that the right
Domain Expert gateway fires without you naming it, that the engagement context was read, and that a
custom-object implication surfaces as an open question rather than a design.

## 6 — First real task

Take one genuine piece of work end to end — request, gateway, builder, post-build consults, artefact.
Confirm the §6.2 proposals appear and that the artefact lands under `clients/<name>/`. If a specialist
proposes a custom object, the answer is the open question, not the table.

## 7 — Client-specific specialists (rare)

Only when the client has a genuinely non-standard process that the roster mis-routes — and **not under
`.claude/skills/`**, committed or not: the doctor's E-17 and `tests/engine-config.test.mjs` count that directory
against `engine.config.json`'s roster, so an extra directory there is `roster.skills 28 ≠ 29 found`, a FAIL. Keep
it as a file under `clients/<name>/`, ask Claude to read it when the engagement is loaded, and record why in the
engagement's decision records. Prefer engagement context over a new specialist: a default recorded in
step 3 costs nothing to maintain.

## No engagement named yet

Design work does not wait for an engagement, in `design-only` and in `live` mode alike. A request with no
client named is answered in the reply as usual — the Constraint Envelope included, with no question about
a folder first — and the design artefacts it produces are saved under `clients/_unfiled/`, never in a
session scratchpad or a temp directory, which do not survive a restart. The reply says where each file
went. `clients/` is gitignored as a whole, so `_unfiled` cannot be committed any more than an engagement
can.

`_unfiled` holds design artefacts and nothing else. A change to an instance is recorded in an engagement's
state file, so in `live` mode, when a session with no engagement named reaches its first write to an
instance, the Architect asks once — *Which engagement is this for?* — and waits. The answer is the
engagement in the update-set name (`<engagement>-<topic>`, `governance/mcp-protocols.md` §2.2) and the state
file the change is recorded in. The Architect never records an instance change under `_unfiled`: that folder
can hold one client's work next to another's, and a change to a client's instance is the one record that
has to say whose it is.

When you name the engagement, say which of that work belongs to it: only what this session produced moves
into `clients/<name>/`, to the folder the artefact belongs in (`designs/`, `stories/`…). Anything else in
`_unfiled` stays there until you say which engagement it is for — one folder is never the place two
clients' work is mixed.

## Maintenance

**After any major event** — a workshop, a refinement, a go-live — update the engagement-state file
with what changed, and record any architectural decision as a decision record.

**Monthly.** Re-read the engagement context as if you were new to it. Anything stale, wrong, or no
longer true is a routing error waiting to happen.

## Troubleshooting

**The wrong specialist keeps firing.** The engagement context is probably silent on something the
architect is inferring. State it explicitly in step 3's file.

**Artefacts are landing in the repository root.** The output location was not passed on dispatch. Every
dispatch carries one; name `clients/<name>/…` explicitly.

**Work from two clients has mixed.** Stop. One session belongs to one engagement. Start a new session
for the other client rather than continuing.
